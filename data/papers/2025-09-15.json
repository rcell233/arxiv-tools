    "paper_abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies, training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER - weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.",

However, many existing databases face limitations in size, emotional balance, and speaker diversity. This study describes the MSP-Podcast corpus, summarizing our ten-year effort. The corpus consists of over 400 hours of diverse audio samples from various audio-sharing websites, all of which have Common Licenses that permit the distribution of the corpus. We annotate the corpus with rich emotional labels, including primary (single dominant emotion) and secondary (multiple emotions perceived in the audio) emotional categories, as well as emotional attributes for valence, arousal, and dominance. At least five raters annotate these emotional labels. The corpus also has speaker identification for most samples, and human transcriptions of the lexical content of the sentences for the entire corpus. The data collection protocol includes a machine learning-driven pipeline for selecting emotionally diverse recordings, ensuring a balanced and varied representation of emotions across speakers and environments. The resulting database provides a comprehensive, high-quality resource, better suited for advancing SER systems in practical, real-world scenarios.",

    "paper_abstract": "Today, Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) has become the mainstream architecture for speaker verification task, in which the ECAPA-TDNN is one of the state-of-the-art models. The current works that focus on improving TDNN primarily address the limitations of TDNN in modeling global information and bridge the gap between TDNN and 2-Dimensional convolutions. However, the hierarchical convolutional structure in the SE-Res2Block proposed by ECAPA-TDNN cannot make full use of the contextual information, resulting in the weak ability of ECAPA-TDNN to model effective context dependencies. To this end, three improved architectures based on ECAPA-TDNN are proposed to fully and effectively extract multi-scale features with context dependence and then aggregate these features. The experimental results on VoxCeleb and CN-Celeb verify the effectiveness of the three proposed architectures. One of these architectures achieves nearly a 23% lower Equal Error Rate compared to that of ECAPA-TDNN on VoxCeleb1-O dataset, demonstrating the competitive performance achievable among the current TDNN architectures under the comparable parameter count.",

Existing approaches either require additional training or are simply not competitive. The evaluation in prior work is also relatively loose, typically using a tolerance of more than 200 ms. In this work, we discover attention heads in Whisper that capture accurate word alignments and are distinctively different from those that do not. Moreover, we find that using characters produces finer and more accurate alignments than using wordpieces. Based on these findings, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting word alignments by filtering attention heads while teacher forcing Whisper with characters. Our approach not only does not require training but also produces word alignments that are more accurate than prior work under a stricter tolerance between 20 ms and 100 ms.",

While this inductive bias may ease the system design, our work aims to develop a more generic front-end for feature extraction. Furthermore, we seek to unify the front-end architecture contrasting with existing approaches that apply a composition of several layer topologies originating from different sources. The experiments systematically show how to reduce the influence of existing techniques to achieve a generic front-end. The resulting 2D convolutional front-end is parameter-efficient and suitable for a scenario with limited computational resources unlike large models pre-trained on unlabeled audio. The results demonstrate that this generic unified approach is not only feasible but also matches the performance of existing supervised learnable feature extractors.",

We further ask, if drift is detected, whether we can fine-tune the detector using similarly drifted data, reduce the drift, and improve the detection performance. On a toy dataset and the large-scale MLAAD dataset, we show that the drift caused by new text-to-speech (TTS) attacks can be monitored using distances between the distributions of the new data and reference data.

At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not affect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by the voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are compared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the gap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD.

To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese & English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task.

    "paper_abstract": "On one hand, recent advances in chatbots has led to a rising popularity in using these models for coding tasks. On the other hand, modern generative image models primarily rely on text encoders to translate semantic concepts into visual representations, even when there is clear evidence that audio can be employed as input as well. Given the previous, in this work, we explore whether state-of-the-art conversational agents can design effective audio encoders to replace the CLIP text encoder from Stable Diffusion 1.5, enabling image synthesis directly from sound. We prompted five publicly available chatbots to propose neural architectures to work as these audio encoders, with a set of well-explained shared conditions. Each valid suggested encoder was trained on over two million context related audio-image-text observations, and evaluated on held-out validation and test sets using various metrics, together with a qualitative analysis of their generated images. Although almost all chatbots generated valid model designs, none achieved satisfactory results, indicating that their audio embeddings failed to align reliably with those of the original text encoder. Among the proposals, the Gemini audio encoder showed the best quantitative metrics, while the Grok audio encoder produced more coherent images (particularly, when paired with the text encoder). Our findings reveal a shared architectural bias across chatbots and underscore the remaining coding gap that needs to be bridged in future versions of these models. We also created a public demo so everyone could study and try out these audio encoders. Finally, we propose research questions that should be tackled in the future, and encourage other researchers to perform more focused and highly specialized tasks like this one, so the respective chatbots cannot make use of well-known solutions and their creativity/reasoning is fully tested.",

Usable cough recordings plus demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on speech foundation models were trained on cough recordings. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second segments, was further evaluated with demographic and clinical features.\nFindings\nThe best audio-only classifier achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB+ from all others (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus OR. Adding demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% (TB+/Rest) and 84.2% (TB+/OR). At a threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, and 80.6% and 73.1% for TB+/OR.\nInterpretation\nCough analysis using speech foundation models, especially when combined with demographic and clinical data, showed strong potential as a TB triage tool, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks. The model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability, indicating detection of genuine disease-related acoustic patterns.

This is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel FSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the single consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both autoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter achieving superior audio quality and faster decoding.

Based on those annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system, while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where the recognized word sequence was correct.

    "paper_abstract": "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.",

    "paper_abstract": "We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet filtering on objective separation metrics.",

    "paper_abstract": "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is a challenging task requiring accurate classification of both seen and unseen classes. Within this domain, Audio-visual GZSL emerges as an extremely exciting yet difficult task, given the inclusion of both visual and acoustic features as multi-modal inputs. Existing efforts in this field mostly utilize either embedding-based or generative-based methods. However, generative training is difficult and unstable, while embedding-based methods often encounter domain shift problem. Thus, we find it promising to integrate both methods into a unified framework to leverage their advantages while mitigating their respective disadvantages. Our study introduces a general framework employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches. We first employ generative adversarial networks to synthesize unseen features, enabling the training of an OOD detector alongside classifiers for seen and unseen classes. This detector determines whether a test feature belongs to seen or unseen classes, followed by classification utilizing separate classifiers for each feature type. We test our framework on three popular audio-visual datasets and observe a significant improvement comparing to existing state-of-the-art works. Codes can be found in this https URL.",

    "paper_abstract": "The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

    "paper_abstract": "Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan, which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.",

In detail, we demonstrate that angular loss further improves the performance compared to the standard contrastive loss. Our method leverages SpecAugment followed by a self-attention mechanism to encapsulate diverse information of augmented input versions into one unified embedding. We evaluate our approach on MetaAudio, a benchmark including five datasets with predefined splits, standardized preprocessing, and a comprehensive set of few-shot learning models for comparison.

In this paper, we propose a beamforming approach that processes specific angular sectors based on their spherical polar coordinates before applying an end-to-end multichannel, multi-speaker ASR system. This method is data-independent and training-free. We demonstrate that using a group of beamformed signals improves ASR performance compared to using the same number of raw microphone signals. Moreover, increasing the number of signals used for beamforming further enhances recognition accuracy, leading to a more efficient use of multichannel signals while reducing the overall input load for the ASR system. We conduct experiments on the AMI meeting corpus, where the proposed method reduces word error rate by up to 11% and improves speaker counting accuracy by up to 27% relative compared to a multichannel ASR baseline system that does not exploit beamforming.",

With extensive ablation studies for both small ($\\sim$20k) and large ($\\sim$1.8M) supervised training sets, we show that CR brings consistent improvement over supervised baselines which already heavily utilize data augmentation, and CR using stronger augmentation and multiple augmentations leads to additional gain for the small training set. Furthermore, we extend the use of CR into the semi-supervised setup with 20K labeled samples and 1.8M unlabeled samples, and obtain performance improvement over our best model trained on the small set.",

While most existing codecs rely on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC, and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second, we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.",

    "paper_abstract": "Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample, requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.",
