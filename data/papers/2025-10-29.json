    "paper_abstract": "Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding. In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder, which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially boost performance of other biasing methods.",

While recent methods have improved performance through sophisticated modality fusion, it remains unclear to what extent the two modalities are complementary in current audio-visual captioning models and how robust these models are when one modality is degraded. We address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward the audio stream in LAVCap. To evaluate how balanced audio-visual captioning models are in their use of both modalities, we augment AudioCaps with textual annotations that jointly describe the audio and visual streams, yielding the AudioVisualCaps dataset. In our experiments, we report LAVCap baseline results on AudioVisualCaps. We also evaluate the model under modality robustness tests on AudioVisualCaps and the results indicate that LAVCap trained on AudioVisualCaps exhibits less modality bias than when trained on AudioCaps.",

Among existing approaches, forward convolutional prediction (FCP) has recently attracted attention. It typically employs a deep neural network to predict the direct-path signal and subsequently estimates a linear prediction filter to suppress residual reverberation. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the required linear prediction filter is often excessively long, leading to considerable computational complexity. To address this, our work proposes a novel FCP method based on Kronecker product (KP) decomposition, in which the long prediction filter is modeled as the KP of two much shorter filters. This decomposition significantly reduces the computational cost. An adaptive algorithm is then provided to iteratively update these shorter filters online. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional methods, our approach achieves competitive dereverberation performance while substantially reducing computational cost.",

However, codec-based TTS faces limitations due to the challenges of pretraining robust speech codecs and the quality degradation introduced by quantization errors. Emerging evidence suggests that continuous-valued generative models can alleviate these issues and serve as a promising alternative. Yet, effectively modelling diverse speech patterns and developing reliable sampling strategies for continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we propose BELLE, Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling for TTS, a novel continuous-valued AR framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms from textual input. BELLE treats each mel-spectrogram frame as a Gaussian distribution sampled from a learned hyper distribution, enabling principled uncertainty estimation, particularly in scenarios with parallel data (i.e., one text-audio prompt paired with multiple speech samples). To obtain such data, diverse speech samples are synthesized using multiple pre-trained TTS models given the same text-audio prompts, which are distilled into BELLE via Bayesian evidential learning. Experimental results indicate that BELLE demonstrates highly competitive performance compared with the current best open-source TTS models, even though BELLE is trained on a large amount of synthetic data and uses only approximately one-tenth of their training data.

    "paper_abstract": "Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance. However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness. Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while maintaining the distortionless constraint.",
    "paper_abstract_zh": "固定波束成形技术由于不依赖噪声统计估计且性能相对稳定，在实践中被广泛应用。然而，单一波束成形器无法适应变化的声学环境，限制了其干扰抑制能力。为解决这一问题，引入了自适应凸组合（ACC）算法，通过线性组合多个固定波束成形器的输出来提高鲁棒性。但ACC在高度非平稳场景（如快速移动干扰）中往往失效，因为其自适应更新无法可靠跟踪快速变化。为克服这一局限，本文提出了一种面向多个无失真差分波束成形器的在线神经融合框架，通过神经网络估计组合权重。与传统ACC相比，所提方法能更有效地适应动态声学环境，在保持无失真约束的同时实现更强的干扰抑制。",

    "paper_abstract": "Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.",
    "paper_abstract_zh": "从语音中提取特征是语音信号处理中最关键的步骤。梅尔频率倒谱系数（MFCC）是大多数说话人识别和语音识别应用中最广泛使用的特征，因为该特征的滤波过程与人耳中的滤波过程相似。但该特征的主要缺点是仅提供信号的频率信息，而无法提供特定频率在何时出现的信息。小波变换凭借其灵活的时频窗，能够提供信号的时间和频率信息，是分析非平稳信号（如语音）的合适工具。然而，由于其均匀的频率缩放特性，典型的小波变换在分析语音信号时可能效果较差，在低频区域的频率分辨率较低，且与人耳听觉感知不符。因此，有必要开发一种结合MFCC和小波变换优点的特征。许多研究尝试将这两种特征相结合。目前基于小波变换的梅尔尺度特征提取方法在梅尔尺度滤波后应用小波变换时计算量较大，因为增加了额外的处理步骤。本文提出了一种结合小波变换概念在时域提取梅尔尺度特征的方法，从而降低了时频转换的计算负担和小波提取的复杂度。将所提出的时域梅尔频率小波系数（TMFWC）技术与储备池计算方法结合，显著提高了音频信号处理的效率。",

    "paper_abstract": "Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\\% temporal, -35.2\\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.",
